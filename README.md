# SunnyDayBot

Daily market forecast report generated by a Rust pipeline and published via MkDocs to GitHub Pages.

## What It Does
- Fetches historical prices for NASDAQ, S&P 500, and Nikkei 225.
- Trains a Prophet model on the most recent window of data.
- Forecasts the next 30 days and classifies the current price as BUY/SELL/HOLD.
- Renders charts and writes `docs/index.md` for MkDocs.

## Requirements
- Rust toolchain (stable)
- Python 3.11+ (only for MkDocs deploy)

## Local Run
```bash
cargo run --release
```

Artifacts:
- `docs/index.md`
- `docs/*_forecast.png`

## Deploy
The GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on a schedule and on manual dispatch:
- Builds and runs the Rust forecast.
- Deploys `docs/` to GitHub Pages using `mkdocs gh-deploy`.

## Configuration
Adjust these constants in `src/main.rs`:
- `TICKERS` for tracked indices
- `HISTORY_YEARS`, `TRAIN_DAYS`, `FORECAST_DAYS`
- `THRESH` for BUY/SELL thresholds
